i want to make a project using react/next.js/supabase/shadcn/tailwind. This project will allow you to manage the agenda for events. Events will have a title, notes, an optional second title, date range, attendee list with email addresses, the hours of operations for those days. The items on the agenda will have a duration, topic, and a list of sub-items. As events are added they should fall on the timeline from the start of the event. it will automatically calculate the start and end time for all of the items based on where they are order wise and their duration. I need a -----+------ style separator between each item and a handle so they can be drag/dropped to re-sort. The start and end times for all items will need to be recalculated after and change in sort. I also want buttons to move the item up one, down one, to the beginning, and to the end. If the duration of an event gets changed the schedule will have to be recalculated. If an item won't complete by the end of the day, it will move to the next day. If we are on the final day go ahead and book it beyond the end of the day as neccessary. We need to be able to create a PDF report of the event. There is a logo file that I will provide and a sample excel file from a previous event that you can use to seed mock data initially. I don't want to be using mock data for long though, let's get this connected to supabase early on in the process. No login page, user info, landing page, etc. for now. Just this utility app. I need it to look beautiful.

Technology stack: React Next.js Supabase Tailwind CSS (for styling) Shadcn/UI component library A nice icon library A nice font - Inter to start with
